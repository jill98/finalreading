<h2>Design is the Rendering of Intent</h2>
<p>In this article, Jared M. Spool outlines how the design of a website typically mimics the intent of the creators; simple and colorful designs are crafted to be inviting, while overly complex and dull designs will deter the viewers from exploring the site. To capture this idea, Spool starts by comparing two different programs: the Global Entry program and the We The People online petition system. The US Customs and Border Protection agency launched the prototype of the Global Entry program in 2008 to allow pre-verified, low-risk travelers to receive expedited clearance to re-enter the United States. And while the concept of the program is simple and solid, the design of the site is quite unattractive and very hard to navigate, requiring multiple windows and riddled with cryptic error messages. Spool believes that with "the first impression of the program, it sends the message that you're entering a bureaucratic process of grand government proportions." In comparison, the We The People online petition system "brought state-of-the-art website production values, taking advantage of typography, layout, and color, along with a smart interaction design, to make it easy for visitors to sign existing petitions or add a new one," despite <i>also</i> being created by a government design team. Spool believes that, although both groups are well-meaning and only want their poeple to interact successfully with the site, the designs differ in attractiveness based on the intentions of the programmers, and not because of any difference in content or applications. While Global Entry was created for the sole purpose of functioning, We The People wanted to invite people to come, and encourage people to engage in policy decisions. This requires a more catching look to the design than a website solely meant to function as a tool.</p>

<h2>Reading Critical Designs: Supporting Reasoned Interpretations of Critical Design</h2>
<p>This article, which was written by Jeffery Bardzell, Shaowen Bardzell, and Erik Stolterman of Indiana University, argues that, with the rise of attention for Critical Design in both HCI and design research, it's important to cultivate a community adept at interpreting critical designs in order to modernize this program. According to the writers, Critical Design is "intended to be relatively easy to learn, to try out, and to teach, in the hopes of inviting more members of the HCI community to engage in this practice." This program is also typically viewed as an art-based approach to design research, due to resemblances with contemporary artworks, while also being mediated by a field of experts who understand the field's history, theory, and practice.</p>

<h2>My Website Plan</h2>
<p>My idea for my website is to create an informative and interactive experience that will promote the Enhanced T lifestyle to Liberal Arts students and help teach a condensed cheatsheet for HTML, CSS, and Markdown, along with a practice platform. My intention for my design is to be very attractive and simplistic, and the tone of the content very genuine and personal, especially since the content (website design) is not always the easiest subject to pick up. From what I gathered from Spool's article, planning my intentions of the site is vital before rendering the program. And since my program is a study tool/educational site, simplicity in both aesthetic and function is critical. However, one of the most useful design tool's they bring up is the Matrix of Common Argument Types, which outlines a website's design through intersecting dimensions of interaction design and criticality. The interaction design dimensions are represented in six categories:
<li>Topic/Problem Space</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Functionality</li>
<li>Interactivity</li>
<li>Form</li>
<li>Materiality</li>
And then the criticality dimension categories are as following:
<li>Changing Perspectives</li>
<li>Proposals for Change</li>
<li>Enhancing Appreciation</li>
<li>Reflectiveness</li>
</p>

<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
<li>What is the rendering of the programmers intent when the website is attractive but difficult to navigate?</li>
<li>If a website is solely meant to be a tool, not an experience, does it have to have that level of attractiveness?</li>
